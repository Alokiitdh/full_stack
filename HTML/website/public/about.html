<h1>About my Cat</h1>
<p>A lovely cat moves through the world with an effortless kind of grace. Her paws touch the floor so lightly it’s as if she’s floating, and her tail sways like a soft, elegant ribbon. Sunbeams are her favorite place to rest—she’ll curl into a warm golden patch and close her eyes, purring as though the sunlight itself is singing to her.</p>
<p>Despite her quiet nature, she has a playful spark. A drifting feather or a crinkling leaf can turn her into a tiny whirlwind of excitement. And when she’s done, she returns to you, settling beside you with a gentle nudge—as if to say that in her small, peaceful world, you are her favorite companion.</p>
